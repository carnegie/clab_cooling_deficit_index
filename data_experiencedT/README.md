# Data for Experienced Temperature project

## Analysis of economic development and increasing temperatures

The data required for the analysis consists of historical data and SSP projections of GDP and historical data and RCP projections of the temperature related variables cooling degree days (CDD) and Heat Index (HI).

The data used in this analysis was collected from the following sources:

### GDP data
Historical GDP Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) data was collected from the World Bank. The data is available at the following link: 
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD
Historical GDP data is in constant 2017 international dollars.


### Cooling degree days (CDD)

Historical population weighted cooling degree days are obtained from the [EIA Weather, Climate and Energy Tracker](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/weather-for-energy-tracker).

Projections of population weighted cooling degree days for different SSP/RCP scenarios are obtained from the publication ["Future cooling gap in shared socioeconomic pathways", Andrijevic et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2195).


## Air conditioning adoption data

Data on air conditioning adoption is obtained from the EIA's [Percentage of households equiped with AC](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/percentage-of-households-equiped-with-ac-in-selected-countries-2018), and data from the GDL and OECD databases published in ["Future cooling gap in shared socioeconomic pathways", Andrijevic et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2195).
